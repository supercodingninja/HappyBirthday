      <h1>The Art of Giving<h6>by F. D. Thomas, Jr.</h6></h1>
      <p>
          No one has the power to waste my time;
          <br><br>And giving my time is Never a waste.
          <br><br>The hour come where I must give;
          <br><br>and emulate The One, Who gave.
      </p>

      <p class="delay1">
          In all I have, I will give my all:
          <br><br>I will give to All, to whom I am Called.
          <br><br>I will give without hesitation, or self-preservation;
          <br><br>and I will give without prejudice, or  reservation.
      </p>

      <p class="delay2">
          I will give more than I take:
          <br><br>how well I serve others defines what I make.
          <br><br>My giving will be authentic, and influential;
          <br><br>However, open to reception is most crucial.
      </p>

        The Five Laws of Stratospheric Success, from The Go-Giver: A Little Story about a Powerful Business Idea is a business book written by Bob Burg and John D. Mann. It is a story about the power of giving. The first edition was published on December 27, 2007 by Portfolio Hardcover.  Here are the laws:
        The Law of Value: Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.

    <br>The Law of Compensation: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.

    <br>The Law of Influence: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first.

    <br>The Law of Authenticity: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.

    <br>The Law of Receptivity: The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.

    <br><br>Thank you for giving of yourself as Christ Jesus did.
